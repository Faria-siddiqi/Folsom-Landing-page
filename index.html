                <h2>Web Design</h2>
                <p>Web design revolves around developing the visual and layout aspects of a website. Therefore, the goal
                    of a web designer is to ensure that the website has a user-friendly interface and is visually
                    pleasing to encourage visitors to stay on the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our web design clients usually expect a website with elements that generate conversion and can work
                    across different devices. Our Folsom web design experts are updated on the latest design trends, and
                    they understand the best practices.

                <p>On the other hand, web development involves building and maintaining a website. This role is more
                    technical, needing the developer to understand coding processes and programming languages. Our
                    developers can turn the designers' ideas into fully-functional websites with proper configurations
                    of databases and servers.</p>

                    love your website. Therefore, making us a part of your business success online will work. If you
                    need an expert that can develop websites on your behalf, we are the right company to come to with

                <h2>Search Engine Optimization </h2>
                <p>Search engine optimization is both an art and science that involves optimizing your website for
                    search engines. By using the proper maximization techniques, your website can rank highly,
                    preferably on the first page of Google, which results in more people visiting the page. While
                    understanding the importance of SEO is easy, it is difficult to achieve a proper and high ranking
                    all by yourself. As a person who doesn't specialize in SEO, you may not understand the ropes.
                    Furthermore, if you resort to hiring an in-house team, you will spend considerable amounts on
                    salaries, insurance, and the equipment and software needed to achieve a proper SEO result.</p>
                <p>Working with a company like Architected Relations is a better solution. It allows you to pay
                    affordable monthly premiums while your business benefits from the expertise and equipment of an
